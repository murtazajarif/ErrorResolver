# Error Resolver

Error Resolver is an open-source project designed to assist developers in finding solutions for non-generic languages, with a focus on GoLang. It aims to provide a better alternative to traditional forums like Stack Overflow by offering a centralized platform for error resolution.


## Features

- Language-specific error resolution: Error Resolver focuses on supporting non-generic languages, starting with GoLang. Developers can easily search for specific error messages and find relevant solutions tailored to their programming language.
- Centralized knowledge base: The project maintains a comprehensive knowledge base of common errors encountered in GoLang development, along with their corresponding resolutions. This helps developers quickly find solutions without needing to browse through multiple sources.
- Contributor-friendly: Error Resolver encourages contributions from the developer community. Developers can add new error messages and their resolutions to expand the knowledge base, making it a collaborative platform to benefit the entire community.
- User-friendly interface: The project provides an intuitive user interface built with JavaScript, EJS, HTML/CSS, and MongoDB. The interface allows developers to search for error messages, view solutions, and contribute their own knowledge to the platform.
